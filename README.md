# APC-Project
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) in C bypasses the fixed memory limits of standard data types like int and long to prevent arithmetic overflow. By utilizing dynamic memory and doubly linked lists to store numbers as flexible digit sequences, it enables exact calculations for integers of any size limited only by system memory.
